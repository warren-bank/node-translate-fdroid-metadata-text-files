Call me Ishmael.

● Some years ago -- never mind how long
&nbsp;&nbsp;precisely -- having little or no money
&nbsp;&nbsp;in my purse, and nothing particular to
&nbsp;&nbsp;interest me on shore, I thought I
&nbsp;&nbsp;would sail about a little and see the
&nbsp;&nbsp;watery part of the world.
● It is a way I have of driving off the
&nbsp;&nbsp;spleen and regulating the circulation.
● Whenever I find myself growing grim
&nbsp;&nbsp;about the mouth; whenever it is a
&nbsp;&nbsp;damp, drizzly November in my soul;
&nbsp;&nbsp;whenever I find myself involuntarily
&nbsp;&nbsp;pausing before coffin warehouses, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;bringing up the rear of every funeral
&nbsp;&nbsp;I meet; and especially whenever my
&nbsp;&nbsp;hypos get such an upper hand of me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;that it requires a strong moral
&nbsp;&nbsp;principle to prevent me from
&nbsp;&nbsp;deliberately stepping into the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;and methodically knocking people&#39;s
&nbsp;&nbsp;hats off -- then, I account it high
&nbsp;&nbsp;time to get to sea as soon as I can.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ This is my substitute for pistol and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ball.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ With a philosophical flourish Cato
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throws himself upon his sword; I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quietly take to the ship.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ There is nothing surprising in this.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they but knew it, almost all men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their degree, some time or other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cherish very nearly the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs -- commerce surrounds it with her surf.

● Right and left, the streets take you
&nbsp;&nbsp;waterward. Its extreme downtown is the
&nbsp;&nbsp;battery, where that noble mole is
&nbsp;&nbsp;washed by waves, and cooled by
&nbsp;&nbsp;breezes, which a few hours previous
&nbsp;&nbsp;were out of sight of land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Look at the crowds of water-gazers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.

● Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties
&nbsp;&nbsp;Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;northward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ What do you see? -- Posted like
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silent sentinels all around the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;town, stand thousands upon thousands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of mortal men fixed in ocean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reveries.
● Some leaning against the spiles; some
&nbsp;&nbsp;seated upon the pier-heads; some
&nbsp;&nbsp;looking over the bulwarks of ships
&nbsp;&nbsp;from China; some high aloft in the
&nbsp;&nbsp;rigging, as if striving to get a still
&nbsp;&nbsp;better seaward peep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ But these are all landsmen; of week
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days pent up in lath and plaster --
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tied to counters, nailed to benches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clinched to desks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ How then is this? Are the green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fields gone? What do they here?
