Call me Ishmael.

● Some years ago -- never mind how long
&nbsp;&nbsp;precisely -- having little or no money in
&nbsp;&nbsp;my purse, and nothing particular to
&nbsp;&nbsp;interest me on shore, I thought I would
&nbsp;&nbsp;sail about a little and see the watery part
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the world.
● It is a way I have of driving off the
&nbsp;&nbsp;spleen and regulating the circulation.
● Whenever I find myself growing grim about
&nbsp;&nbsp;the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
&nbsp;&nbsp;November in my soul; whenever I find myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;involuntarily pausing before coffin
&nbsp;&nbsp;warehouses, and bringing up the rear of
&nbsp;&nbsp;every funeral I meet; and especially
&nbsp;&nbsp;whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of
&nbsp;&nbsp;me, that it requires a strong moral
&nbsp;&nbsp;principle to prevent me from deliberately
&nbsp;&nbsp;stepping into the street, and methodically
&nbsp;&nbsp;knocking people&#39;s hats off -- then, I
&nbsp;&nbsp;account it high time to get to sea as soon
&nbsp;&nbsp;as I can.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ This is my substitute for pistol and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ball.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ With a philosophical flourish Cato throws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself upon his sword; I quietly take to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ship.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ There is nothing surprising in this. If
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they but knew it, almost all men in their
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degree, some time or other, cherish very
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nearly the same feelings towards the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs -- commerce surrounds it with her surf.

● Right and left, the streets take you
&nbsp;&nbsp;waterward. Its extreme downtown is the
&nbsp;&nbsp;battery, where that noble mole is washed by
&nbsp;&nbsp;waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few
&nbsp;&nbsp;hours previous were out of sight of land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.

● Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;from thence, by Whitehall, northward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ What do you see? -- Posted like silent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentinels all around the town, stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousands upon thousands of mortal men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fixed in ocean reveries.
● Some leaning against the spiles; some
&nbsp;&nbsp;seated upon the pier-heads; some looking
&nbsp;&nbsp;over the bulwarks of ships from China; some
&nbsp;&nbsp;high aloft in the rigging, as if striving
&nbsp;&nbsp;to get a still better seaward peep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ But these are all landsmen; of week days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pent up in lath and plaster -- tied to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counters, nailed to benches, clinched to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ How then is this? Are the green fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone? What do they here?
